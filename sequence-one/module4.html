                        <p>Students are required to read and reflect on, in this case, a media article on a topical stem cell science issue.</p>

                        <p>This will not only encourage consideration of stem cell science but also elicit progression of student beliefs and understanding.</p>

                        <p>The following two websites provide background on the pedagogical approach:</p>

                        <p>In addition to the information presented, in large groups, the session can be run with an ‘inner circle’ and an ‘outer circle’. The Socratic discussion is then run in two phases. Initially only the students in the inner circle are allowed to contribute to the discussion. Subsequently, students in the outer circle swap with the students in the inner circle and the discussion continues.</p>
                        <p>The focus of this activity should be on developing student knowledge and understanding of stem cell science and potential for medical therapies. Students should appreciate the difference between those therapies that have been substantiated through clinical trials and those that are yet to be proven. The focus should be on the science and not on the moral and ethical issues. These are dealt with in Sequence 2.</p>

                <h5>Activity</h5>
                <p><strong>Magazine Activity</strong></p>
                <div class="description">
                    <p>This activity allows students to take on the roles of different members of a magazine publication team tasked with preparation of a special “Stem Cell” edition.</p>
                    <div class="more">
                        <p>The emphasis of the magazine must be to provide readers with scientifically sound information; avoiding all hype.  Students should be encouraged to write scientifically rather than journalistically.</p>
                        <p>Students can choose their role based on strengths and interests from the following list:</p>
                        <p><strong>Editor</strong> – Responsible for writing the introduction for the special “Stem Cell” edition of the magazine and provides readers with an insight into what the magazine will cover. The editor must therefore work closely with the reporters and other contributors to pull a 150 - 300 word summary together in the From the Editor section. The editor is also responsible for the structure of the magazine including the order of the stories and word count adherence.  (Appoint 1 or 2 students to the role of editors).</p>
                        <p><strong>Graphics Supervisor</strong> – Responsible for the Magazine logo and must work with the editors and graphic artists to ensure the logo and Special Edition name are linked. The logo design should represent the latest in stem cell technology and be accompanied with a 100 -250 word description of the meaning behind the logo. The Graphic Supervisor works in conjunction with the graphic artists and ensures the magazine look and feel is consistent.</p>
                        <p><strong>Front Cover Graphic Artist</strong> – Responsible for creating the magazine's Front Cover and writing the 100-250 word description describing the relevance to “Stem Cells” and this edition of the magazine. The Front Cover Graphic Artist must work with the Back Cover Graphic artist and assist reporters with image design if required. The graphics and word description should be specific to stem cell scientific understanding and knowledge with all images correctly referenced.</p>
                        <p><strong>Back Cover Graphic Artist</strong> – Responsible for creating the magazine's Back Cover and writing the 250-word description describing the relevance to “Stem Cells” and this edition of the magazine. The Back Cover Graphic Artist must with the Front Cover Graphic artist and assist reporters with image design if required. The graphics and word description should be specific to stem cell scientific understanding and knowledge with all images correctly referenced.</p>
                        <p><strong>Reporters</strong> – The remainder of the students are reporters that take on specific areas and are responsible for writing 250 – 500 word stories according to the following role descriptions. Ideally each story should fit on a half A4 page and include 1 or 2 relevant images. The layout and images are to be chosen by the reporter, with input from the editors and graphic designers.  All reporters are required to write a 50-word summary for the editor to explain the intention of the article. This must be supplied prior to writing the article.
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Reporter - New Technology</strong>   (1 to 3 students with individual stories examining new stem cell technology applications) Focus on new technology in the area of stem cell therapies.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Politics</strong> (1 to 2 students examining the latest in policy decision making, funding or legal issues relating to stem cell technology)</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Patient Advocate</strong> (1 to 2 students examining the impact of stem cells on patients and the importance of stem cell treatment)</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Latest from the Laboratory</strong> (1 to 3 students investigate the latest research being undertaken in the area of stem cells) Focus on the the use of stem cells in other areas of medical and biological research.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Media Review</strong> (1 to 3 students identify recent media articles specific to an area of stem cells and reviews the content in a blog format)</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Australian News</strong> (1 to 2 students examine an area of stem cell research from Australian research institutions).</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Sport</strong> (1 to 2 students examine the application of stem cell technology in the sports arena and the impact on sports people).</li>
                            <li><strong>Reporter – Human Interest Story</strong> (1 to 2 students use knowledge of stem cell therapy to provide a human interest story)</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Once completed the magazine can be published as an electronic magazine on the school website providing a valuable resource for the latest in Stem Cell technology.</p>
