                    <p>In September 2014 the SBS Insight Program aired Episode 22: Stem Cells.  In this program  the views of frustrated patients are presented. Tired waiting for clinical breakthroughs to be supported by clinical data, some have turned to unproven stem cell therapies locally or overseas. In addition, the voices of other key stakeholders present their points of view.</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>Stem cell research is often in the news. However, for those who look to stem cells to alleviate their suffering it can sometimes be difficult to know if the latest ‘breakthrough’ means the chance of a treatment now or many, many years into the future.</p>
                    <p>Often lacking from media coverage is clarity about whether the new stem cell discovery is part of preclinical research (where a new approach is first explored in the laboratory and in animal studies); a clinical trial (where it is being evaluated in humans) or an approved evidence-based treatment.</p>
                    <div class="more">
                        <p>The following SBS articles are examples students may investigate:</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>By performing a Google search, the latest news articles should be located. Some recent examples include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Scientists correct defective gene in stem cells in fight against rare and deadly ataxia telangiectasia or AT (published online by The Courier Mail, 28th Feb 2016)</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>In assessing the findings students will need to determine whether the source is credible and the data accurate as per the intended outcomes. It is important to ascertain whether the information is, for example, published but only preclinical; published data from a clinical trial; speculative data based on anecdote.</p>
                        <p>Are the claims substantiated by a peer-reviewed publication?  Are they an announcement from a national regulatory body ie the announcement of a new clinical trial (so still yet to be proven) or a company stating that the TGA have approved a new stem cell-based treatment?</p>

                    <p>For example, should Australian doctors be allowed to sell unproven stem cell treatments using the patient’s own cells (so called autologous ‘stem cell’ therapies) or should regulations be tightened to protect patients from physical and financial harm? If we tighten Australian regulations would that mean that more patients will be forced to travel overseas? Do patients have a right to try whatever they want or should they have to wait for evidence? Should stem cell technology be used to generate sperm cells or embryos from stem cells?</p>

                <div class="description">
                    <p>In January 2015 the Australian Therapeutic Goods Association released the “Regulation of autologous stem cell therapies Discussion paper for consultation” to allow community input into the current loophole in Australian Stem Cell legislation that allows clinics to offer autologous stem cells as therapy.</p>
                    <p>There are many different groups – so called stakeholders - in the community who have a direct and indirect interest in stem cell research.</p>
                    <p><strong>Task 1:</strong> Students are to identify broad stakeholder groups and then provide examples of individuals in each group developing a comprehensive list of stakeholders.</p>

                            <li>Should Australian legislation be changed to make it more difficult to market and sell unproven stem cell treatments?</li>
                            <li>What impact would tightening Australian regulation have for patients trying to access treatment or for scientists from universities and biotechnology companies seeking to develop their research?</li>
                            <li>If there is no change to curb the sale of unproven treatment, could this impact on development of the Australian stem cell industry?</li>

                <div class="description">
                    <p><strong>Setting the scene:</strong> This drama role-play draws upon stem cell therapy, a contemporary controversial issue in science with global implications. Through both students and teacher taking on roles in the drama we can more closely consider the perspectives of the stakeholders in this issue, and explore language and ideas in relation to stem cell research and therapies.</p>
                    <p><strong>Context:</strong> A TV studio for recording of an SBS Insight style TV program.</p>
                    <p><strong>Roles:</strong> students as various stakeholders (see previous preparations and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/doc/stem-cell-sequence-2-stakeholder-cards.pdf">stakeholder cards - pdf 39kb</a>). Teacher is in role as the TV program host who facilitates the discussion on the topic. </p>
                    <p><strong>Teacher-in-role:</strong> The strategy of teacher-in-role requires the teacher (in this case playing the role of the host/facilitator) to help build belief in the drama context (a TV discussion program on stem cells) without losing sense of the important learning that needs to take place. It is important that the teacher does not get carried away with the performance because in this teaching strategy they are both the teacher and the role.  As host they guide the discussion amongst the people in the studio but as teacher, they are ensuring that all students have a chance to contribute, and the important points of learning are made.</p>
                    <p><strong>Debrief:</strong> A debriefing of the role-play (everyone out of role) is an important final stage of the process.</p>

                        <li>The teacher sets the scene and begins by taking on the role of the TV program host and students as representatives of stakeholder groups (an item of costume or a prop such as a microphone can help signify role). The host could begin by building some atmosphere with an introduction to the TV program such as this <a class="slide-down-link" href="#"> piece to camera</a>:

                                <p><i>Welcome to tonight’s program.</i></p>
                                <p><i>Stem cell therapy is a burgeoning and relatively new area of scientific research, and one that offers hope to many people who suffer from chronic and/or degenerative illnesses. Funded scientific research and formal regulation of the field is struggling to keep up with the global demand for these therapies that are desperately sought after by some as a cure for currently incurable diseases. People desperate for medical treatment can become easy targets for rogue operators selling little more than hope.</i></p>
                                <p><i>Now you are a researcher in this area</i> [gesturing towards a student in role] <i>do you believe stem cell tourism is a threat to legitimate stem cell research?</i></p>
                                <p>[Continue facilitating a productive discussion with interesting juxtaposition of views to make it interesting TV.]</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>The host/facilitator is guided by the key and additional questions and provides opportunity for each stakeholder group to share their perspective and for other stakeholders to challenge them or add to their arguments.</li>
                        <li>If required, build in an ‘ad break’ in order to review progress of the whole class role-play and where necessary provide information and encouragement before resuming the program.</li>
                        <li>Bring the program to a conclusion.  Teacher and students de-role.</li>
                        <li>Finally, hold a debriefing discussion with the students out of role.  This allows the students to ask questions and express some of their own ideas as themselves.</li>
